# Implementation Plan: Box style contract – three-tier level system

**Branch**: `feat/001-box-style-contract` | **Date**: 2026-05-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)

## Summary

Formalise the three-tier level system (L1 box / L2 panel / L3 section) by consolidating style resolution into `frame_loader.py`, removing duplicate styling decisions from the renderer, deriving gap and padding from semantic role, and migrating text measurement to HarfBuzz. All four allowed box styles map correctly from Frame properties to SVG output.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11

**Primary Dependencies**: None beyond stdlib + existing engine modules

**Testing**: pytest (`test_frame_loader.py`, `test_layout_v3.py`, `test_parity.py`)

**Target Platform**: SVG output + HTML preview server

**Constraints**: All 20+ existing diagrams must render without regression. request-to-hardware-stack is the visual reference.

## Constitution Check

| Article | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| I. Anti-patch protocol | ✅ Pass | This is a contract change, properly classified |
| II. Layer ownership | ✅ Pass | Style resolution moves entirely into frame_loader.py (the owning layer for defaults) |
| III. DIAGRAM.md is the visual contract | ✅ Pass | Implementation aligns with the four allowed box styles already defined in DIAGRAM.md |
| IV. Test before ship | ✅ Planned | Full diagram render regression test after each change |
| V. Sensible defaults | ✅ Core goal | This feature exists to make defaults correct |

## Architecture

### Current state (problems)

1. **Style resolution is split across two layers.** `frame_loader.py` sets some defaults (leaf→SOLID border, container→NONE border). But `_render_frame()` in `layout_v3.py` re-derives fill colours at render time based on `is_container`, `border`, and `fill` – duplicating and sometimes contradicting the loader's intent.

2. **Grey fill is inconsistent.** Some containers get grey from the renderer's `is_container + border==NONE → GREY` logic. But containers with explicit `border: solid` (like headed panels in request-to-hardware-stack) don't trigger this path, so their fill depends on what the YAML author wrote. Leaf boxes inside grey containers sometimes have `fill: grey` manually to look right – a style leak that violates the semantic YAML principle.

3. **Heading text position is not enforced.** The heading is synthesised as a `__heading` child frame, but its text position depends on the child's layout – which can end up centred or offset depending on alignment defaults.

4. **The `+1px` padding hack.** Borderless frames (annotations, containers) add 1px to padding_left, padding_top, and padding_right to compensate for the missing stroke width. This is fragile, makes padding non-uniform, and breaks when boxes change style dynamically.

5. **Double padding.** Panel children sit at `panel_padding + child_padding` from the panel edge. When both use INSET (8px), the visual distance from panel edge to child text is 16px+, which looks like double spacing compared to a standalone box.

### Target state

1. **Single style resolver in frame_loader.py.** After loading, every Frame has fully resolved fill, border, stroke colour, and text-weight fields computed from its level (either depth-derived or explicit `level:` override). The renderer reads these directly – zero style logic in `_render_frame()`. The `+1px` padding compensation is deleted; every box has a 1px stroke, making padding uniform.

2. **Four styles map to clear conditions – universal 1px stroke rule:**

Every visible box has a 1px stroke. The stroke colour matches the fill for boxes that shouldn't show a border, or is `transparent` for annotations. This eliminates the `+1px` padding compensation hack entirely – padding is uniform across all box types.

| Style | Condition | Fill | Stroke colour | Text weight |
|-------|-----------|------|---------------|-------------|
| Outlined box | Level 1 (default for depth 2+), no variant | transparent | `#000000` | 400 (regular) |
| Grey box | Level 2 (default for depth 1), or explicit `level: 2` | `#F3F3F3` | `#F3F3F3` | 700 for heading, 400 for label |
| Annotation | `variant: annotation` | transparent | `transparent` | 400 |
| Highlight | Any frame with `variant: highlight` | `#000000` | `#000000` | preserved, text forced white |

Note: `border: dotted` (renamed from legacy `dashed`) is reserved for panels acting as network boundaries and future zone overlays. It is not one of the four primary box styles – it is a border mode applied to a panel.

Separators and all box types share the same outer footprint because every rect includes the 1px stroke geometry.

3. **Heading is always top-left.** The `__heading` synthetic child uses top-left alignment, padding from INSET token.

### Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations. This is a straightforward consolidation of existing scattered logic into one path.

## Key Validation Scenarios

1. **Minimal container + leaf YAML** – no explicit styling → correct defaults
2. **request-to-hardware-stack** – visual parity with current output (the reference)
3. **lt-diagram-generator** – highlight variant still works
4. **support-engineering-flow** – cards with text hierarchy render correctly
5. **android-security-comparison** – text is top-left, not centred
6. **Full regression** – all diagrams in `scripts/diagrams/frames/` render without error
