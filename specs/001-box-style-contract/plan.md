# Implementation Plan: Box style contract – two-tier model

**Branch**: `feat/001-box-style-contract` | **Date**: 2026-05-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)

## Summary

Formalise the two-tier box visual model (outlined leaf / grey container) by consolidating style resolution into a single path in `frame_loader.py`, removing duplicate styling decisions from the renderer, and ensuring all four allowed box styles map correctly from Frame properties to SVG output.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11

**Primary Dependencies**: None beyond stdlib + existing engine modules

**Testing**: pytest (`test_frame_loader.py`, `test_layout_v3.py`, `test_parity.py`)

**Target Platform**: SVG output + HTML preview server

**Constraints**: All 20+ existing diagrams must render without regression. request-to-hardware-stack is the visual reference.

## Constitution Check

| Article | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| I. Anti-patch protocol | ✅ Pass | This is a contract change, properly classified |
| II. Layer ownership | ✅ Pass | Style resolution moves entirely into frame_loader.py (the owning layer for defaults) |
| III. DIAGRAM.md is the visual contract | ✅ Pass | Implementation aligns with the four allowed box styles already defined in DIAGRAM.md |
| IV. Test before ship | ✅ Planned | Full diagram render regression test after each change |
| V. Sensible defaults | ✅ Core goal | This feature exists to make defaults correct |

## Architecture

### Current state (problems)

1. **Style resolution is split across two layers.** `frame_loader.py` sets some defaults (leaf→SOLID border, container→NONE border). But `_render_frame()` in `layout_v3.py` re-derives fill colours at render time based on `is_container`, `border`, and `fill` – duplicating and sometimes contradicting the loader's intent.

2. **Grey fill is inconsistent.** Some containers get grey from the renderer's `is_container + border==NONE → GREY` logic. But containers with explicit `border: solid` (like headed panels in request-to-hardware-stack) don't trigger this path, so their fill depends on what the YAML author wrote. Leaf boxes inside grey containers sometimes have `fill: grey` manually to look right.

3. **Heading text position is not enforced.** The heading is synthesised as a `__heading` child frame, but its text position depends on the child's layout – which can end up centred or offset depending on alignment defaults.

### Target state

1. **Single style resolver in frame_loader.py.** After loading, every Frame has fully resolved `fill`, `border`, and text-weight fields. The renderer reads these directly – zero style logic in `_render_frame()`.

2. **Four styles map to clear conditions:**

| Style | Condition | Resolved fill | Resolved border | Text weight |
|-------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Outlined box | Leaf, no variant, border≠none | transparent | SOLID | 400 (regular) |
| Grey box | Container, or leaf with explicit `fill: grey` | `#F3F3F3` | NONE | 700 for heading, 400 for label |
| Annotation | Leaf with `border: none`, no fill override | transparent | NONE | 400 |
| Highlight | Any frame with `variant: highlight` | `#000000` | NONE | preserved, text forced white |

3. **Heading is always top-left.** The `__heading` synthetic child uses top-left alignment, padding from INSET token.

### Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations. This is a straightforward consolidation of existing scattered logic into one path.

## Key Validation Scenarios

1. **Minimal container + leaf YAML** – no explicit styling → correct defaults
2. **request-to-hardware-stack** – visual parity with current output (the reference)
3. **lt-diagram-generator** – highlight variant still works
4. **support-engineering-flow** – cards with text hierarchy render correctly
5. **android-security-comparison** – text is top-left, not centred
6. **Full regression** – all diagrams in `scripts/diagrams/frames/` render without error
